# Shopping List App Exercise

## Objective:

Create a simple web-based shopping list application where users can:

1. Add items to the list.
2. View the list of items.

## Requirements:

### HTML:

1. An input field to add a new item.
2. A button to submit the new item to the list.
3. A list (e.g., `<ul>` or `<ol>`) to display the items.
4. A way to remove items from the list (consider a "remove" button next to each item).

### JavaScript:

1. Add the functionality to add items to the list from the input field.
2. Implement the "remove" feature for each item.

### (Optional) CSS:

1. Use Bootstrap or custom styles to enhance the look and feel of your application.
2. Ensure it is mobile-responsive.

## Steps:

1. Set up the basic HTML structure.
2. Implement the JavaScript to handle the addition of new items.

## Tips:

- Use `document.createElement` to dynamically create new list items.
- Attach event listeners dynamically to each "remove" button.
- (Optional) Use local storage to remember the items even if the page is refreshed.
